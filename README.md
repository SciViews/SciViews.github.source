# Source for the SciViews Web Site

This is the source code created with [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) for building https://www.sciviews.org with [hugo](https://gohugo.io) and hosted in the `SciViews.github.io` Github repository.

_The rest of this README file is mostly a reminder to me about how to set up those sites._

Those two repositories are totally separated, because it is easier for me to commit and push to them separately, i.e., to focus on source, and push to `SciViews.github.io` *only* when I am happy with a totally finalized task. I thus followed instructions [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/github-pages.html) to set up those two repositories separately, using `publishDir = "../SciViews.github.io"` in `config.toml`.
