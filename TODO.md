# SciViews Web site - To do list

- The site is currently essentially an empty shell. Need to incorporate the material prent elsewhere, especially the zooimage files and the tclt/tk guide

- The 404 page should be reworked (style, links, preloader)

- Rework preloader as for svPkgdown

- Provide a footer that svPkgDown can reuse automatically

- Use UMONS colors

- Make the top bar smaller.

- Change font to better match Gitbook + syntax highlighting similar to svPkgdown

- Dark mode

- French version (how?)
