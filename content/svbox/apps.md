> Additional applications for the [SciViews Box](https://www.sciviews.org/software/svbox/) can be easily installed from here (also accessible from the `Apps` button at the bottom of the **SciViews Box Configuration** panel). Download the application(s) you want **for your SciViews Box version** into the default `Downloads` folder, then log out the SciViews Box and log in again to trigger their installation.

To know which applications are already installed in your SciViews Box, go to the configuration dialog and click the `About` button, just at the left of the `Apps` button. Installed applications are listed in the `# SciViews applications:` section in the order they were (re)installed.

If you fail to install an application you have downloaded (for instance, if you answered **No** when you were asked for its installation), just redownload and reinstall the application.
